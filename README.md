# natours-react

"Natours" is a website designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for his course on Advanced CSS. This repository is a React.js adaptation of the same layout, with a few additional elements:

- CSS Grid.
- randomuser API to generate randomized "stories".
- Context API as state management for the modal.
- Webpack 5, Babel and PostCSS
- Dropped deprecated @import syntax in favor of @use for sass.
- Live version of the [site deployed on Netlify](https://adoring-kepler-e1e37a.netlify.app/).
